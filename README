USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This repo contains various ebuild hacks and tests targeting Gentoo package
managers. It is used to check standards compliance, test for bugs, and other
package manager related development. None of the ebuilds in this repo are
meant to be permanently installed on a system and some could even have
unexpected side effects if built or installed.
